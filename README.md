# Employee Attrition Prediction

This project predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the company using a machine learning model (Logistic Regression). SMOTE is used to handle class imbalance and Scikit-learn pipeline is used for model training and evaluation.

## 📁 Files

- `employee_attrition_4.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with full ML pipeline
- `employee attrition.csv`: Dataset used for training
- `attrition_model.pkl`: Optional - saved model file

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for plots)
